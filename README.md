# BikeShareDataAnalysis

**Successfully Analysed data**

In this project, I perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share
system provider for many major cities in the United States. 
I compared the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. 
I also saw if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered,
regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.

Each of these cities has a page where we can freely download the trip data.:

    New York City (Citi Bike): Link
    Chicago (Divvy): Link
    Washington, DC (Capital Bikeshare)
